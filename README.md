# AngularSeed

Basic bash script to create simple demonstration Angular App with :
* one empty css in assets directory
* one index.html file with one controller
* one app.js file with one controller

Add one argument : the name of the App

You maybe want to install first npm (plenty of tutorials on the web), bower, and angular :
* npm install -g bower
* bower init
* bower install -S angular
